@Deep Framework and can be used to copy properties from one object to another. A good example would be the need to copy attributes from a Java Bean (e.g. TO or VO) into a Java Entity. However, any attributes can be copied from any source class to a destination class.

In its first version, @Deep can be used to copy the following properties:

  * 1. primitive types
  * 2. Wrapper Classes
  * 3. Complex Types (developer specific classes)

Copying Lists and Maps will be offered in the coming version.
